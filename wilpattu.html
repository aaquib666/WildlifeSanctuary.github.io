    <h1 id="wilpattu-title">Unveiling the Past: Wilpattu National Park's Rich History</h1>
     
    <p>Nestled within the verdant expanse of the Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts, Wilpattu National Park (WNP) stands as Sri Lanka's largest and one of its oldest 
        protected areas, encompassing 131 thousand hectares of diverse landscapes. Established between 1938 and 1973 under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, this 
        wilderness marvel is a crucial sanctuary for elephants, a habitat for the elusive Sri Lankan leopard, and a haven for the sloth bear. Distinguished by its dense forest 
        cover, WNP unveils a tapestry of dry zone forests, thorny scrub, open plains, and the unique Villu wetlands. Reddish cliffs rising dramatically from 
        the shores of Portugal Bay and Dutch Bay add a captivating dimension to the scenery. In proximity to the ancient city of Anuradhapura, the park boasts 
        ancient ruins and artifacts, echoing the historical resonance of the region. Recognized as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention in 2013, 
        WNP, along with adjacent marine wetlands, estuaries, and reservoirs, spans 165,800 hectares, making it a vital component of this ecological haven known as the 
        "Land of Villu" ; a name derived from the basin-shaped lakes, or Villus, scattered throughout its terrain. Covering almost 2% of Sri Lanka's total land area, 
        Wilpattu National Park embodies a rich history, initially declared a Reserved Forest in 1903 and later designated as a game sanctuary in 1905 to safeguard wildlife 
        from hunting.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Wilpattu National Park is nestled in the northern regions of Sri Lanka, spanning the Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts and bordering Mannar and Vavuniya Districts. Encompassing an expansive 131,000 hectares, it stands as the country's largest and one of its oldest protected areas.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Historical Significance:</strong> Established between 1938 and 1973 under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, Wilpattu National Park holds historical roots dating back to 1903 when part of it was initially declared a Reserved Forest. Evolving from a hunting ground for the elite during British rule, the park has undergone a remarkable transformation into a vital conservation area, embodying a shift in societal attitudes towards the preservation of its rich wildlife.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Optimal Visiting Period:</strong> The recommended time to explore Wilpattu National Park is between February and July. This period offers an optimal experience for visitors as lower water levels encourage wildlife to emerge into open areas, enhancing the chances of encountering the park's diverse inhabitants, including elephants, Sri Lankan leopards, and sloth bears.</li><br>
