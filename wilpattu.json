      "description": "Nestled within the verdant expanse of the Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts, Wilpattu National Park (WNP) stands as Sri Lanka's largest and one of its oldest protected areas, encompassing 131 thousand hectares of diverse landscapes. Established between 1938 and 1973 under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, this wilderness marvel is a crucial sanctuary for elephants, a habitat for the elusive Sri Lankan leopard, and a haven for the sloth bear. Distinguished by its dense forest cover, WNP unveils a tapestry of dry zone forests, thorny scrub, open plains, and the unique Villu wetlands. Reddish cliffs rising dramatically from the shores of Portugal Bay and Dutch Bay add a captivating dimension to the scenery. In proximity to the ancient city of Anuradhapura, the park boasts ancient ruins and artifacts, echoing the historical resonance of the region. Recognized as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention in 2013, WNP, along with adjacent marine wetlands, estuaries, and reservoirs, spans 165,800 hectares, making it a vital component of this ecological haven known as the 'Land of Villu' ; a name derived from the basin-shaped lakes, or Villus, scattered throughout its terrain. Covering almost 2% of Sri Lanka's total land area, Wilpattu National Park embodies a rich history, initially declared a Reserved Forest in 1903 and later designated as a game sanctuary in 1905 to safeguard wildlife from hunting.",
